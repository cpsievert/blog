Carson enjoys developing software and creating products that make data analysis more accessible and interactive. For example, his [contributions to plotly](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/graphs/contributors) have made advanced interactive web graphics accessible to R users. Those contributions also earned him the 2017 John Chambers Statistical Software Award. Carson has over 5 years experience developing data science software, as well as formal training in traditional statistical methods -- allowing him to attack challenging problems with domain expertise from many different areas. Whether it's a novel visualization for better model interpretation ([LDAvis](https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis)), or a customized (shiny) web-application for exploring multiple datasets (e.g., [zikar](https://github.com/cpsievert/zikar), [pedestrians](https://github.com/cpsievert/pedestrians), [eechidna](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/eechidna/), [bcviz](https://github.com/cpsievert/bcviz)); Carson pushes the frontier of R and JavaScript to help (himself and others) derive insight from data in a reusable, portable, reproducible, and accessible way.
