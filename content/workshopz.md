title: "Workshops/training"

Below is list of workshops I've run in the past (some with the help of others). I enjoy running workshops that are highly interactive (attendees are expected to bring a laptop, follow some short lectures/demos, periodically complete exercises, and ask questions). Although programming is an important component of these workshops, I strive to assume a minimal amount of prior programming knowledge, and use programming solely as a means to an end: **accessible, transparent, dynamic, interactive, and informative data analysis products**. I've covered a wide range of "data science in R" topics (e.g, data visualization, data wrangling, statistical modeling, dynamic reporting with rmarkdown/knitr, building web applications with shiny, acquiring data from the web, etc), but I'm happy to produce new materials upon request.
