<!--
I offer a wide variety of consulting services via Sievert Consulting LLC. This page outlines some of those services, explains how they complement each other, and provides a deeper look into.

I help my clients[^1] turn data into insight and actionable software products. For example, I've built interactive web pages to visualize [housing/census](/software/#bcviz) data, monitor [disease outbreak](/software/#zikar), and recognize patterns in [foot traffic](/software/#pedestrians). I've also created programming interfaces that [earth scientists](/software/#plotdap), [sabermetricans](/software/#pitchrx), and other [analysts](/software/#plotly) use to do their work more efficiently. I pull on this experience to *rapidly* build prototypes for my clients -- which ensures we don't waste time on the wrong problem.

I'm also available to run [workshops](/talkz) to help train and educate your team about free and open source data science (I'm a trusted [RStudio instructor](https://www.rstudio.com/instructors/)!)

<!--
Although I call myself a data scientist, I try to avoid using overly generic terms when discussing data analysis, because everyone has a different mental model of what it is and how it is (should be) done. Rather than simply claim I can *quickly* help you visualize, explore, and understand data, I would rather outline specifically how I've done that for prior clients. If you think I can help your organization, [contact me](mailto:cpsievert1@gmail.com) or [Plotly](https://plot.ly/products/consulting-and-oem/)
