I'm super excited to announce that plotly 4.6.0 is now on CRAN! Go ahead and install it with:
<code>
install.packages("plotly")
</code>

This release brings a ton of new features and improvements -- some of which are over in the year making. I recently held a webinar introducing the biggest features, including <a href="https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/linking-views-without-shiny.html">linked views</a>, <a href="https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/key-frame-animations.html">animation</a>, and <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/">crosstalk</a> integration. In addition to the webinar <a href="https://vimeo.com/214301880">recording</a>, some good resources for getting up-to-speed include new demos (`demo(package = "plotly")`), help pages (`help(highlight)` and `help(animation)`), and the official <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/blob/master/NEWS.md">NEWS</a> file. I also recommend checking out my <a href="https://vimeo.com/cpsievert">vimeo page</a> for some more advanced applications of the linked views framework.

My upcoming <a href="https://plotcon.plot.ly/workshops">plotcon workshop</a> will be a great opportunity to learn all these new features over 2 full days of lectures, demos, hands-on exercises, and one-on-one Q&amp;A.

PS. I can't wait to see what you do with these new features! And I always love hearing from the community; so <a href="https://twitter.com/cpsievert">tweet me</a> if you run into issues/questions, want to share your work, and/or just want to say hi! :)
