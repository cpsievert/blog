[MLBAM's website](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/) hosts a wealth of data that informs the [MLB Gameday application](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/scoreboard). Most notably, this website hosts pitch-by-pitch (ie, PITCHf/x) and play-by-play data. [pitchRx](https://github.com/cpsievert/pitchRx) provides a simple interface to acquire a good portion of Gameday data (see Table 1 of [my paper](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/accepted/sievert.pdf)), but there is a significant amount that isn't directly accessible using `pitchRx::scrape`. This post will show you some general techniques to acquire and manipulate data from this website.

## Constructing Gameday urls

When scraping data off the web, typically the first task is to construct [urls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator) that point to the information of interest. Sometimes this is difficult, but thankfully, the Gameday site structure urls in a sensible fashion. In fact, if we are searching for game specific data, the full address can be constructed from the Gameday identifier. To demonstrate, let's grab Gameday identifiers for MLB and Triple-A games played in August of 2014 ([this post](http://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/pitchrx-meet-openwar-4/) has more on searching Gameday identifiers with regular expressions).

```{r setup, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(XML2R)
opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, eval = FALSE)
```

```{r bb}
library(pitchRx)
# Load gameday identifiers
data(gids, package = "pitchRx")
data(nonMLBgids, package = "pitchRx")
# Subset MLB identifiers to August, 2014
MLBids <- gids[grepl("2014_08_[0-9]{2}", gids)]
# Subset to Triple-A games in August, 2014
AAAids <- nonMLBgids[grepl("2014_08_[0-9]{2}_[a-z]{3}aaa_[a-z]{3}aaa", nonMLBgids)]
ids <- c(MLBids, AAAids)
ids[1] 
```

```r
## [1] "gid_2014_08_01_phimlb_wasmlb_1"
```

The function `pitchRx::makeUrls` can then be used to pre-append the path required to reach 'game directories'.

```{r makeUrls}
paths <- makeUrls(gids = ids)
paths[1]
```

```r
## [1] "http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2014/month_08/day_01/gid_2014_08_01_phimlb_wasmlb_1"
```

Within each game directory, there are a bunch of files (to see them, click on the link above). Note that `pitchRx::scrape` has support for acquiring: [miniscoreboard.xml](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2014/month_08/day_01/gid_2014_08_01_phimlb_wasmlb_1/miniscoreboard.xml), [players.xml](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2014/month_08/day_01/gid_2014_08_01_phimlb_wasmlb_1/players.xml), [inning/inning_all.xml](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2014/month_08/day_01/gid_2014_08_01_phimlb_wasmlb_1/inning/inning_all.xml), and [inning/inning_hit.xml](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2014/month_08/day_01/gid_2014_08_01_phimlb_wasmlb_1/inning/inning_hit.xml) files; but any of these XML files can be harvested using **XML2R**.

## Motivating XML2R

While developing **pitchRx**, I found myself writing a lot of redundant R code that repeatedly transformed similarly structured XML documents into a list of data frames. Through this discovery, I found a reasonable way to abstract the common tasks into a small number of functions/conventions which are bundled into a separate R package named [XML2R](https://github.com/cpsievert/XML2R). In fact, [I have a vignette](http://cpsievert.github.io/XML2R/) which explains how **pitchRx** uses **XML2R** to acquire PITCHf/x data. I intend to write more sports data scrapers on top of **XML2R** (e.g., [bbscrapeR](https://github.com/cpsievert/bbscrapeR)) and possibly combine them into a central R package.

### From urls to observations

The fundamental idea behind **XML2R** is that any XML structure can be coerced into a _list of observations_. Here I will transform a bunch of [rawboxscore.xml](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2014/month_08/day_01/gid_2014_08_01_phimlb_wasmlb_1/rawboxscore.xml) files into a list of observations using `XML2Obs`:

```{r obs, eval = FALSE}
library(XML2R)
urls <- paste0(paths, "/rawboxscore.xml")
obs <- XML2Obs(urls) # this will take a minute
```

```{r lies, echo = FALSE}
# saveRDS(obs, file = "obs.rds")
obs <- readRDS(file = "obs.rds")
```

The `names` of this list keeps track of the XML hierarchy. In some sense, this hierarchy can be thought as defining an observational unit. **XML2R** has functionality for combining and creating links between observations, but we won't cover that here. Instead, let's take a peek at the top 5 observational units in terms of the count of observations within each level.

```{r counts}
nms <- names(obs)
top <- sort(table(nms), decreasing = TRUE)
head(top)
```

```r
## nms
##              boxscore//team//batting//batter 
##                                        26205 
## boxscore//team//pitching//pitcher//strikeout 
##                                        14047 
##       boxscore//linescore//inning_line_score 
##                                         8652 
##            boxscore//team//pitching//pitcher 
##                                         7153 
##      boxscore//team//pitching//pitcher//walk 
##                                         5799 
##                    boxscore//umpires//umpire 
##                                         3349
```

Just because, here are two observations from the most popular observational unit:

```{r batter}
batter <- obs[grepl("^boxscore//team//batting//batter$", nms)][1:2]
batter
```

```r

```

Note that each observation (or each list element) is a character matrix with one row. This makes it easy to row bind observations at a later point.

```{r str}
str(batter)
```

```r
## List of 2
##  $ boxscore//team//batting//batter: chr [1, 1:46] "0" "0" "Ryan Howard" "1B" ...
##   ..- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
##   .. ..$ : NULL
##   .. ..$ : chr [1:46] "hr" "sac" "name_display_first_last" "pos" ...
##  $ boxscore//team//batting//batter: chr [1, 1:43] "0" "1" "Roberto Hernandez" "262" ...
##   ..- attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
##   .. ..$ : NULL
##   .. ..$ : chr [1:43] "hr" "sac" "name_display_first_last" "first_sac" ...
```

## From observations to data frame(s)

For our purposes, I just want to see how audience attendance differs across ballparks in both the MLB and Triple-A. To investigate, I'll just grab the "boxscore" observational unit:

```{r scores}
bs <- obs[grepl("^boxscore$", nms)]
bs[1]
```

```r
## $boxscore
##      wind             game_type venue_name       home_sport_code
## [1,] "15 mph, L to R" "R"       "Nationals Park" "mlb"          
##      attendance official_scorer game_pk  date             status_ind
## [1,] "28,410"   "Dave Matheson" "382175" "August 1, 2014" "F"       
##      home_league_id elapsed_time game_id                      venue_id
## [1,] "104"          "2:28"       "2014/08/01/phimlb-wasmlb-1" "3309"  
##      weather              gameday_sw
## [1,] "79 degrees, cloudy" "P"       
##      url                                                                                                              
## [1,] "http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2014/month_08/day_01/gid_2014_08_01_phimlb_wasmlb_1/rawboxscore.xml"
```

Now, since `scores` is a list of observations all with the same observational unit, we can collapse the observations into a matrix. 

```{r collapse}
unique(names(bs))
bs.mat <- collapse_obs(bs)
bs.mat[1:5, !grepl("url", colnames(bs.mat))] #first 5 records without "url" column
```

```r
##      wind                game_type venue_name                   
## [1,] "15 mph, L to R"    "R"       "Nationals Park"             
## [2,] "3 mph, L to R"     "R"       "Oriole Park at Camden Yards"
## [3,] "7 mph, In from CF" "R"       "Progressive Field"          
## [4,] "8 mph, In from CF" "R"       "Comerica Park"              
## [5,] "0 mph, None"       "R"       "Marlins Park"               
##      home_sport_code attendance official_scorer  game_pk  date            
## [1,] "mlb"           "28,410"   "Dave Matheson"  "382175" "August 1, 2014"
## [2,] "mlb"           "39,487"   "Jim Henneman"   "382177" "August 1, 2014"
## [3,] "mlb"           "27,009"   "Bob Maver"      "382179" "August 1, 2014"
## [4,] "mlb"           "39,052"   "Dan Marowski"   "382170" "August 1, 2014"
## [5,] "mlb"           "20,410"   "Ronald Jernick" "382169" "August 1, 2014"
##      status_ind home_league_id elapsed_time game_id                     
## [1,] "F"        "104"          "2:28"       "2014/08/01/phimlb-wasmlb-1"
## [2,] "F"        "103"          "2:29"       "2014/08/01/seamlb-balmlb-1"
## [3,] "F"        "103"          "3:23"       "2014/08/01/texmlb-clemlb-1"
## [4,] "F"        "103"          "2:56"       "2014/08/01/colmlb-detmlb-1"
## [5,] "F"        "104"          "2:58"       "2014/08/01/cinmlb-miamlb-1"
##      venue_id weather                   gameday_sw
## [1,] "3309"   "79 degrees, cloudy"      "P"       
## [2,] "2"      "78 degrees, cloudy"      "P"       
## [3,] "5"      "76 degrees, clear"       "P"       
## [4,] "2394"   "81 degrees, clear"       "P"       
## [5,] "4169"   "75 degrees, roof closed" "P"
```

In R, matrices have homogeneous column types and XML2R will always return a character matrix. For this reason, some data cleaning is usually required. In this case, we coerce attendance to an integer type and collect a subset of the columns into a data frame (which can handle heterogeneous column types).

```{r manip}
attendance <- as.integer(gsub("\\,", "", boxscore[,"attendance"]))
venue <- boxscore[,"venue_name"]
# this is here to tell ggplot to sort venues by their median attendance
parks <- names(sort(tapply(attendance, INDEX = venue, median)))
df <- data.frame(attendance, venue = factor(venue, levels = parks),
                 league = boxscore[,"home_sport_code"])
```

## From data frame(s) to insight

Lastly, let's visualize the distribution of single game attendance across ballparks. Not a whole lot of surprise here, but I think it is interesting that the variance is MUCH higher in the major leagues (except for the few teams with a very loyal following -- I'm looking at you Red Sox & Giants fans).

```{r plot, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data = df, x = venue, y = attendance, geom = "boxplot", 
      fill = league) + coord_flip() +
      theme(legend.position = c(0.8,0.2))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("/post/images/attendance.png")
```
