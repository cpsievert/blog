On April 2nd, 2013 Yu Darvish [flirted with pitching
perfection](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/yu-darvish-loses-perfect-game-030913556--mlb.html). To demonstrate his ability to deceive batters with a consistent delivery over different pitch types, [redditor DShep created this
gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1d2z6d/all_of_darvishs_primary_pitches_at_once/), which layers video of five different pitches thrown by Darvish on April 24th:

We can easily recreate pitch trajectories with publicly available PITCHf/x data using the [pitchRx](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pitchRx/) [R](http://cran.r-project.org) package. First, we collect all the pitches thrown by Darvish to Albert Pujols on April 24th:

```{r scrape, results='hide'}
library(pitchRx)
dat <- scrape(start = "2013-04-24", end = "2013-04-24")
atbats <- subset(dat$atbat, pitcher_name == "Yu Darvish" & 
                batter_name == "Albert Pujols")
pitches <- plyr::join(atbats, dat$pitch, by = c("num", "url"))
```

The **pitchRx** package also provides a function called `animateFX()` which makes it easy to animate pitches. 
 Note that we take a different perspective from above by imagining the pitches coming closer as time progresses.

If you're following along, you probably want to do `animation::saveHTML(animateFX(pitches))` instead for a better viewing experience. You can also check out [this post](http://cpsievert.github.io/baseballR/20140818/) to see how to make more interactive animations.

```{r ani, fig.show='animate', interval=0.05, dev="CairoPNG"}
animateFX(pitches)
```

One thing to notice here is the different release points by Darvish (especially for his slider). Furthermore, Darvish didn't even throw a curveball to Pujols. If you look closer at the original gif, you can actually see a different batter (than Pujols) in the batter's box (look for a white bat). Darvish's delivery looks very similar on videotape, but his arm angle (and thus) release point might be slightly different across pitch types according to the PITCHf/x data. Let's take a closer look at Darvish's release point during this start.

```{r release}
atbats <- subset(dat$atbat, pitcher_name == "Yu Darvish")
Darvish <- plyr::join(atbats, dat$pitch, by = c("num", "url"))
qplot(data=Darvish, x=as.numeric(x0), y=as.numeric(z0), color=pitch_type) +
  coord_equal()
```

As you can see, Darvish has quite different release points according to pitch type. For example, his slider tends to be more 'side-arm' compared to his four-seam fastball. Now, whether that difference is distinguishable to the human-eye is another question...

EDIT: Thanks to a recommendation by [@Sky_Kalman](https://twitter.com/Sky_Kalkman), normalizing release points should make it easier to make visual comparison of flight paths across the pitch types. Here is one way to go about that:

```{r normalized, fig.show='animate', interval=0.05, dev="CairoPNG"}
pitches$x0 <- mean(as.numeric(pitches$x0))
pitches$z0 <- mean(as.numeric(pitches$z0))
animateFX(pitches)
```
