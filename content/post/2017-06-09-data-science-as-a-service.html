<p>I take great pride in creating software that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMLVjnRZ3dQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10m41s">enhances the productivity</a> of other data scientists. After all, data scientists need to <em>maximize</em> time spent formulating, examining, and refinining questions about data; and <em>minimize</em> time translating those thoughts into machine code. I’ve <a href="https://cpsievert.github.io/talks/">talked</a> at <a href="http://cpsievert.github.io/talks/20161212a/">great</a> <a href="http://cpsievert.github.io/talks/20161212b/">lengths</a> about how <a href="https://cpsievert.github.io/plotcon17/talk">my work on plotly</a> fits into this context, which roughly speaking, enables data scientists to leverage the many benefits on web-based visualization <em>without any knowledge of web technologies</em>.</p>
<!-- TODO: web-based tools suck for exploratory visualization? -->
<p>This work requires making hard decisions about which abstractions to make, and perhaps more importantly, which abstractions <em>not</em> to make. Doing this well requires an intimate knowledge of the most frustating/difficult tasks for most users which means data science tool developers need to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Be familiar with the vast ecosystem of data science tools or else we risk re-inventing the wheel.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>Get our hands dirty analyzing data, and applying our tools to real problems, or else we risk optimizing for the wrong problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is why a good chunk of my time is spent researching the constantly expanding ecosystem of R packages and using some of those tools to do real data analysis.</p>
<p><!--
  I feel very fortunate to have spent numerous years of my statistics PhD in this domain learing from mentors that have been this sort of work for 30+ years. They helped me not to forget the importance of 1 and 2
  
  instilled in me how important it is to not become hyper-focused on software engineering problems

<li id="fn1"><p>That isn’t to say that “re-inventing the wheel” can’t be a good thing, especially when it leads to a better wheel. In my opinion, especially in academia, there is too much of a focus on whether tool(s) <em>exist</em>, and not nearly enough attention is paid to whether they are <em>usable</em>.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
