If you are anything like me, you spend most of the day wrangling data with
[plyr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html) (or
[dplyr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html)) and visualizing it with
[ggplot2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html). For this reason, I got really
excited when I heard about the [animint](https://github.com/tdhock/animint) package which allows
one to create linked, interactive (even animated) web graphics using ggplot2 code.

This short post demonstrates linked plots using data from the
[pitchRx](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pitchRx/) package. If you click on the bars in the
bar chart below, the corresponding start versus end speed scatterplot should change to reflect the
current selection. I really want to spend more time with animint since it seems to fill a void
where other similar (and also great) packages like [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/) and
[ggvis](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/) currently fall short.

```{r dat, results='asis', tidy=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(pitchRx)
pitches$type <- with(
  pitches, 
  interaction(pitch_type, pitcher_name)
)
counts <- dplyr::count(pitches, pitch_type, pitcher_name, type)
library(animint)
viz <- list(
  bars = ggplot() +
    geom_bar(
      aes(x = factor(pitch_type), 
          y = n, fill = pitcher_name, 
          clickSelects = type),
      position = "dodge", 
      stat = "identity", 
      data = counts
    ) + theme(legend.position = "none"),
  scatter = ggplot() +
    geom_point(
      aes(start_speed, end_speed, 
          fill = pitcher_name, showSelected = type),
      alpha = 0.65, 
      data = pitches)
  )
animint2gist(viz)
```
