Hi, I'm Carson. I recently received my PhD in statistics from Iowa State University. My thesis was on [Interfacing R with Web Technologies for Interactive Statistical Graphics and Computing with Data](https://github.com/cpsievert/phd-thesis). I enjoy developing software and building products that make data analysis more appealing, accessible, and efficient. I release most of my work as open source software under [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/cpsievert) (I'm also currently the maintainer and [primary contributor](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/graphs/contributors) to the R package [plotly](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly)). I'm always looking to learn from and collaborate with new people, so feel free to contact me via Twitter ([@cpsievert](https://twitter.com/cpsievert)) or email ([cpsievert1 AT gmail.com](mailto:cpsievert1@gmail.com)).
