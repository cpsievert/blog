Hi, I'm Carson. I'm a PhD student in the Department of [Statistics at Iowa State University](http://www.stat.iastate.edu) working on interactive graphics, statistical computation, sports statistics, and web technologies. I'm primarily interested in problems where visualization can augment/enhance/improve statistical methods and/or automated tasks. As you can see from my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/cpsievert), I'm  passionate about open source, and I [occasionally tweet](https://twitter.com/cpsievert) about stuff I'm working on.
