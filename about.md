Hi, I'm Carson. I recently received my PhD in statistics from Iowa State University. My thesis was on [Interfacing R with Web Technologies for Interactive Statistical Graphics and Computing with Data](https://github.com/cpsievert/phd-thesis). I enjoy building things that help make data analysis more accessible and efficient. Most of my work is available as open source R packages on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/cpsievert), and I'm also currently the maintainer and [primary contributor](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/graphs/contributors) to the R package [plotly](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly). I'm always looking for new and exciting projects to work on, so please contact me via Twitter ([@cpsievert](https://twitter.com/cpsievert)) or email ([cpsievert1 AT gmail.com](mailto:cpsievert1@gmail.com)) if you would like to collaborate!
